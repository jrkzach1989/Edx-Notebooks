Introducing SQL Magic
Effort: 10 mins

Objective
In this reading, you will learn about the SQL magic commands.

Jupyter notebooks have a concept of Magic commands that can simplify working with Python, and are particularly useful for data analysis. Your notebooks can have two types of magic commands:

Cell magics: start with a double %% sign and apply to the entire cell

Line magics: start with a single % (percent) sign and apply to a particular line in a cell

Their usage is of the format:

%magicname arguments

So far in the course you learned to accessed data from a database using the Python DB-API (and specifically ibm_db). With this API execution of queries and fetching their results involves multiple steps. You can use the SQL Magic commands to execute queries more easily.

For example if you want to execute the a query to select some data from a table and fetch its results, you can simply enter a command like the following in your Jupyter notebook cell:

%sql select * from tablename

Although SQL magic simplifies working with databases, it has some limitations. For example, unlike DB-API, there are no explicit methods to close a connection and free up resources.

In the following tutorial you will learn how to work with SQL magic.
